/*
Future notes on things to do:
- Limit air dashes before touching the ground
- Add an option for wall jump that only allows alternating walls.
- Currently, dashing through walls checks the potential end point, and if it isn't clear then it continues with the normal dash routine. 
    The result is that there could be a valid landing point across a wall, but the player is just a little too close for it to register. 
    I could create a 'look-back' loop that runs through the intervening tiles until it finds an empty landing spot.
- The bounce event is a funny one, because it can have the player going up without being in the jump state. I should perhaps add some error catching stuff for such situations
- Can I have a wall_jump init ahead of the normal jump init? If it's just checking a few more boxes....
- Improve ladder situation: jump from ladder option, bug with hitting the bottom of ladders, other stuff?

- Add check for camera bounds on Dash Init
- Solid actors have a fault: they only check collisions once on enter. This is especially problematic because of how GBStudio does invincibility frames,
  because it means the player can attach to a platform without causing the hit trigger to run. 
     - 2 potential solutions: 
     - give the player a minimum velocity every frame, forcing a re-collision. This might break the moving platform code though
     - manually re-trigger the collision call if the actor is attached.




TARGETS for Optimization
- State script assignment could be 100% be re-written to avoid all those assignments and directly use the pointers. I am not canny enough to do that.
- I should be able to combine solid actors and platform actors into a single check...
- It's inellegant that the dash check requires me to check again later if it succeeded or not. Can I reorganize this somehow?
- I think I can probably combine actor_attached and last_actor
- I need to refactor the downwards collision for Y, it's a bit of a mess at this point. I just can't wrap my head around it atm
- Wall Slide could be optimized to skill the acceleration bit, as the only thing that matters is tapping away

THINGS TO WATCH
- Does every state (that needs to) end up resetting DeltaX?

NOTES on GBStudio Quirks
- 256 velocities per position, 16 'positions' per pixel, 8 pixels per tile
- Player bounds: for an ordinary 16x16 sprite, bounds.left starts at 0 and bounds.right starts at 16. If it's smaller, bounds.left is POSITIVE
    For bounds.top, however, Y starts counting from the middle of a sprite. bounds.top is negative and bounds.bottom is positive
- CameraX is in the middle of the screen, not left corner

GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THIS FILE
The old format was well structured as a state-machine, isolating all the components into states. Unfortunately, it seems like the overhead of calling 
collision functions on the GameBoy makes this model unperformant. However, I'm also limited to the total amount of code that can be placed in a single bank. 
I cannot get rid of the functions and move the code into the file itself. New structure is a compromise that uses goto commands to skip some sections that are
shared by most of the states. 
    
INIT()
    Tweak a few fields so they don't overflow variables
    Normalize some fields so that they are applied over multiple frames
    Initialize variables
UPDATE()
    A. Input Checks (Double-tap Dash, Drop-Through)    I'm considering moving the drop-through check into a state
    B. STATE MACHINE 1 SWITCH: Falling, Ground, Jumping, Dashing, Climbing a Ladder, Wall Sliding
        State Initialization
        Calculate Change in Vertical Movement
        Some calculate horziontal movement
        Some calculate collisions
    C. Shared Collision
        Acceleration Code   
        Basic X Collision           gotoXCol
        Basic Y Collision           gotoYCol
        Actor Collision Check       gotoActorCol
    D. STATE MACHINE 2 SWITCH:      gotoSwitch2
        Animation
        State Change Logic
        Some Counters
    E. Trigger Check                gotoTriggerCol
    G. Tic Counters                 gotoCounters


BUGS:
 - When the player is on a moving platform and is hit by another one, they get caught mid-way on the next one.
